# Robotic Arm
This is a robotic arm that makes use of a claw mechanism to be able to grab small objects. Also using three other servos in changing the orientation of the robotic arm so it can move forwards, backwards, upwards, downwards as well as left and right. Additionally it should be able to make use of wheeels later if I am able to reach my third milestone.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servoâ€™s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is the code for the robotic arm as now the arm can actually move using both the remote control and my phone. I had to make use of an external battery to provide the servos with enough power, to do this I made use of a 6V battery pack and connected it to the shield allowing for the energy to go to servos and also not back into my computer allowing me to avoid frying my computer. I also added edits to the code that the originally had come with the kit to set a home position that the arm would go to when I clicked down the button on the right controller's joystick.

# First Milestone 
My first milestone was finishing the body for the robotic arm and making and finishing all the wiring so that all the servos in the arm as well as the controller was connected to the robotic arm. I had to use a variety of screws, nuts, spacers and self locking nuts. I had a tough time using the self locking nut as I had initially not known that you need to use a plyer when using self locking nuts, but later realized that the self locking nuts were really convenient as they didn't get loosened when the parts were moving so nothing would fly off.

# Starter Project 

My starter project is a motion sensor controlled servo motor. Which is able to scan for motion in intervals of a few seconds so that it can determine whether there was motion and if there was motion than the servo will move clockwise if there isn't any motion the servo will move counter clockwise. Initially the servo motor wass a bit finicky, but I was able to adjust its sensitivity by screwing the potentiometer so that it didn't just detect the slightest of motions but also detected the relatively larger motions.
