# Robotic Arm
This is a robotic arm that makes use of a claw mechanism to be able to grab small objects. Also using three other servos in changing the orientation of the robotic arm so it can move forwards, backwards, upwards, downwards as well as left and right. Additionally it should be able to make use of wheeels later if I am able to reach my third milestone.

# Final Milestone

My final milestone is adding wheels and an ultrasonic sensor onto my robotic arm. The robotic arm can now move using the remote controller and is able to move in all four directions, also using the claw is able to grab things that come within 8 cm using the ultrasonic sensor to determine when something is within its reach. I had to make use of two motor drivers and two 9 volt batteries so that my motors had the power to run, as well as two 6V power sources to power the arduino and the arduino shield making it so that it can run without being plugged into any outlets allowing it to be truly mobile.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is the code for the robotic arm as now the arm can actually move using both the remote control and my phone. I had to make use of an external battery to provide the servos with enough power, to do this I made use of a 6V battery pack and connected it to the shield allowing for the energy to go to servos and also not back into my computer allowing me to avoid frying my computer. I also added edits to the code that the originally had come with the kit to set a home position that the arm would go to when I clicked down the button on the right controller's joystick.

# First Milestone 
My first milestone was finishing the body for the robotic arm and making and finishing all the wiring so that all the servos in the arm as well as the controller was connected to the robotic arm. I had to use a variety of screws, nuts, spacers and self locking nuts. I had a tough time using the self locking nut as I had initially not known that you need to use a plyer when using self locking nuts, but later realized that the self locking nuts were really convenient as they didn't get loosened when the parts were moving so nothing would fly off.

# Starter Project

My starter project is a motion sensor controlled servo motor. It scans for motion in intervals of a few seconds so that it can determine whether there was motion and if there was motion than the servo will move clockwise if there isn't any motion the servo will move counter clockwise. Initially the servo motor wass a bit finicky, but I was able to adjust its sensitivity by screwing the potentiometer so that it didn't just detect the slightest of motions but also detected the relatively larger motions.
